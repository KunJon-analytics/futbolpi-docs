Welcome to **FutbolPi**, your ultimate destination for football predictions, competitive spirit, and Pi Network-powered rewards. Let's dive into the details:

## Our Vision

At FutbolPi, we believe that every football fan has an inner pundit waiting to be unleashed. Whether you're a seasoned strategist or a casual observer, our platform invites you to predict match outcomes, earn points, and climb the leaderboard. But that's not all – we're powered by the Pi Network, where predictions don't just stay predictions; they turn into wins!

2. **Predictions Galore:**

   - We're kicking off with the Euros and Copa America – two thrilling tournaments that keep fans on the edge of their seats.
   - Predict match outcomes, exact scores, and show off your football intuition.

3. **Pilot Phase and Beyond:**

   - As we iterate, test, and fine-tune our platform, we'll be adding more features.
   - Stay tuned for the top 3 European leagues – because who doesn't want to predict Premier League clashes or El Clásico showdowns?

4. **Rewards Await:**
   - Accumulate points by making accurate predictions. Correct outcomes earn you 3 points, while nailing the exact score adds 10 extra points.
